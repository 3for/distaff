# Distaff
Distaff is a zero-knowledge virtual machine written in Rust. For any program executed on Distaff VM, a STARK-based proof of execution is automatically generated. This proof can then be used by anyone to verify that a program was executed correctly without the need for re-executing the program or even knowing what the program was.

### Status
**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.** Distaff is in a very early alpha. This means that current functionality is limited, and there are known and unknown bugs and security flaws.

## Usage
Distaff exposes `processor` module which can be used to execute programs and verify their execution. Both are explained below, but you can also take a look at a working example of a program which calculates n-th term of a Fibonacci sequence [here](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/distaff/blob/master/src/main.rs).

### Executing a program 
To execute a program on Distaff VM, you can use `processor::execute()` function. The function takes the following parameters:

* `program: &[u64]` - the program to be executed, which is just a sequence of [instructions](#Instruction-set).
* `inputs: &[u64]` - inputs for the program. These will be used to initialize the stack. Currently, at most 8 inputs can be provided.
* `num_outputs: usize` - number of elements on the stack to be returned as program output. Currently, at most 8 outputs can be returned.
* `options: &ProofOptions` - config parameters for proof generation. The default options target 96-bit security level.

If the program is executed successfully, the function returns a tuple with 3 elements:

* `outputs: Vec<u64>` - the outputs generated by the program. The number of elements in the vector will be equal to the `num_outputs` parameter.
* `program_hash: [u8; 32]` - an array of 32 bytes representing a hash of the program.
* `proof: StarkProof` - proof of program execution. `StarkProof` implements `serde`'s `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits - so, it can be easily serialized and de-serialized.

#### Program execution example
Here is a simple example of executing a program which pushes two numbers onto the stack and computes their sum:
```Rust
use distaff::{ ProofOptions, processor, processor::opcodes };

// this is our program
let program = [
    opcodes::PUSH, 1,
    opcodes::PUSH, 2,
    opcodes::ADD
];

// let's execute it
let (outputs, program_hash, proof) = processor::execute(
        &program,
        &[],        // we won't initialize the stack with any inputs
        1,          // a single item form the stack will be returned
        &ProofOptions::default()); // we'll be using default options

// the output should be 3
assert_eq!(vec![3], outputs);
```

### Verifying program execution
To verify program execution, you can use `processor::verify()` function. The function takes the following parameters:

* `program_hash: &[u8; 32]` - an array of 32 bytes representing a hash of the program to be verified.
* `inputs: &[u64]` - a list of inputs against which the program was executed.
* `outputs: &[u64]` - a list of outputs generated by the program.
* `proof: &StarkProof` - the proof generated during program execution.

The function returns `Result<bool, String>` which will be `Ok<true>` if verification passes, or `Err<message>` if verification fails, with `message` describing the reason for the failure.

Verifying execution proof of a program basically means the following:

> If a program with the provided hash is executed against the provided inputs, the execution will result in the provided outputs.

Notice how the verifier need to know only the hash of the program - not what the actual program was.

#### Verifying execution example
Here is a simple example of verifying execution of the program from the previous example:
```Rust
use distaff::{ processor };

let program_hash =  /* value from previous example */;
let proof =         /* value from previous example */;

// let's verify program execution
match processor::verify(&program_hash, &[], &[3], &proof) {
    Ok(_) => println!("Execution verified!"),
    Err(msg) => println!("Execution verification failed: {}", msg)
}
```

## Design

Distaff VM is a simple [stack machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine). This means you can push values onto the stack and perform operations with them. 

### The stack
Currently, the stack can be up to 32 items deep (this will be increased in the future). However, the more stack space a program is using, the longer it will take to execute, and the larger the execution proof will be. So, it pays to use stack space judiciously.

Values on the stack must be elements of a [prime field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) with modulus `18446743880436023297` (which can be written as 2<sup>64</sup> - 45 * 2<sup>32</sup> + 1). This means that all values must be between `0` and `18446743880436023296` - this covers pretty much all 64-bit integers.

All arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) also happen in the same prime field. This means that overflow happens after a value exceeds field modulus. So, for example: `18446743880436023296 + 1 = 0`.

### Inputs / outputs
Currently, there are 2 ways to get values onto the stack:

1. You can initialize the stack with a set of inputs as described [here](#Executing-a-program). These inputs are the public inputs into the program. This means, that they must be shared with a verifier for them to verify program execution.
2. You can use `PUSH` operations to push values onto the stack as shown [here](#Program-execution-example). These values become a part of the program itself, and, therefore, cannot be changed between program executions. You can think of them as constants.

A way to provide secret inputs for programs which can change between program executions is not yet available, but will be provided in the future.

Values remaining on the stack after a program is executed can be returned as program outputs. You can specify exactly how many values (from the top of the stack) should be returned. Currently, this number of values is limited to 8. A way to return a large number of values (hundreds or thousands) will be provided in the future.

### Instruction set
Eventually, Distaff will have up to 40 (or more) instructions which will let you write sophisticated programs. For now, only the following 10 instructions have been implemented.

| Operation | Opcode   | Description                            |
| --------- | :------: | -------------------------------------- |
| NOOP      | 00000000 | Does not change the state of the stack. |
| PULL1     | 00001100 | Moves the second to the top stack item (item with index `1`) to the top of the stack. |
| PULL2     | 00001101 | Moves the third to the top stack item (item with index `2`) to the top of the stack. |
| PUSH      | 00010000 | Pushes the value of the next opcode onto the stack. The value can be any field element. |
| DUP0      | 00010001 | Pushes a copy of the top stack item onto the stack (duplicates the top stack item). |
| DUP1      | 00010010 | Pushes a copy of the second to the top stack item onto the stack. |
| DROP      | 00011000 | Removes the top item from the stack. |
| ADD       | 00011001 | Pops top two items from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack. |
| SUB       | 00011010 | Pops top two items from the stack, subtracts the top item from the second to the top item, and pushes the result back onto the stack. |
| MUL       | 00011011 | Pops top two items from the stack, multiplies them, and pushes the result back onto the stack. |

## Performance

Some very informal benchmarks run on Intel Core i5-7300U @ 2.60GHz (single thread):

| Operation Count | Proving time | Verification time | Proof size | Proof RAM  |
| --------------- | :----------: | :---------------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 2<sup>8</sup>   | 60 ms        | 2 ms              | 64 KB      | negligible |
| 2<sup>10</sup>  | 150 ms       | 2 ms              | 86 KB      | negligible |
| 2<sup>12</sup>  | 520 ms       | 2 ms              | 114 KB     | negligible |
| 2<sup>14</sup>  | 2.2 sec      | 3 ms              | 142 KB     | 130 MB     |
| 2<sup>16</sup>  | 9.8 sec      | 3 ms              | 178 KB     | 640 MB     |
| 2<sup>18</sup>  | 44 sec       | 3 ms              | 212 KB     | 2.6 GB     |
| 2<sup>20</sup>  | 6.8 min      | 4 ms              | 254 KB     | > 5.5 GB<sup>1</sup> |

1: RAM on my machine maxed out at 5.5 GB, but for efficient execution ~12 GB would be needed. This probably explains why proving time is so poor for 2<sup>20</sup> case. If there was sufficient RAM available, proving time would have likely been slightly ove 3 mins.
