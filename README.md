# Distaff
Distaff is a zero-knowledge virtual machine written in Rust. For any program executed on Distaff VM, a STARK-based proof of execution is automatically generated. This proof can then be used by anyone to verify that a program was executed correctly without the need for re-executing the program or even knowing what the program was.

### Status
**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.** Distaff is in an early alpha. This means that current functionality is incomplete, and there are known and unknown bugs and security flaws.

## Usage
Distaff crate exposes `execute()` and `verify()` functions which can be used to execute programs and verify their execution. Both are explained below, but you can also take a look at several working examples [here](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/distaff/blob/master/src/main.rs).

### Executing a program 
To execute a program on Distaff VM, you can use `execute()` function. The function takes the following parameters:

* `program: &Program` - the program to be executed. A program can be constructed manually by building a program execution graph, or compiled from Distaff assembly (more info [here](#Writing-programs)).
* `inputs: &ProgramInputs` - inputs for the program. These include public inputs used to initialize the stack, as well as secret inputs consumed during program execution (more info [here](#Program-inputs)).
* `num_outputs: usize` - number of items on the stack to be returned as program output. Currently, at most 8 outputs can be returned.
* `options: &ProofOptions` - config parameters for proof generation. The default options target 120-bit security level.

If the program is executed successfully, the function returns a tuple with 2 elements:

* `outputs: Vec<u128>` - the outputs generated by the program. The number of elements in the vector will be equal to the `num_outputs` parameter.
* `proof: StarkProof` - proof of program execution. `StarkProof` implements `serde`'s `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits - so, it can be easily serialized and de-serialized.

#### Program inputs
To provide inputs for a program, you must create a [ProgramInputs](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/distaff/blob/master/src/programs/inputs.rs) object which can contain the following:

* A list of public inputs which will be used to initialize the stack. Currently, at most 8 public inputs can be provided.
* Two lists of secret inputs. These lists can be thought of as tapes `A` and `B`. You can use `READ` operations to read values from these tapes and push them onto the stack (see [here](#Input-operations)). TODO

Besides the `ProgramInputs::new()` function, you can also use `ProgramInputs::from_public()` and `ProgramInputs:none()` convenience functions to construct the inputs object.

#### Writing programs
TODO

#### Program execution example
Here is a simple example of executing a program which pushes two numbers onto the stack and computes their sum:
```Rust
use distaff::{ self, ProofOptions, ProgramInputs, assembly };

// we'll be using default options
let options = &ProofOptions::default();

// this is our program, we compile it from assembly code
let program = assembly::compile(
    "push.3 push.5 add",
    options.hash_fn()).unwrap();

// let's execute it
let (outputs, proof) = distaff::execute(
        &program,
        &ProgramInputs::none(), // we won't provide any inputs
        1,                      // we'll return a single item from the stack
        &options);

// the output should be 8
assert_eq!(vec![8], outputs);
```

### Verifying program execution
To verify program execution, you can use `verify()` function. The function takes the following parameters:

* `program_hash: &[u8; 32]` - an array of 32 bytes representing a hash of the program to be verified.
* `public_inputs: &[u128]` - a list of public inputs against which the program was executed.
* `outputs: &[u128]` - a list of outputs generated by the program.
* `proof: &StarkProof` - the proof generated during program execution.

The function returns `Result<bool, String>` which will be `Ok<true>` if verification passes, or `Err<message>` if verification fails, with `message` describing the reason for the failure.

Verifying execution proof of a program basically means the following:

> If a program with the provided hash is executed against some secret inputs and the provided public inputs, it will produce the provided outputs.

Notice how the verifier needs to know only the hash of the program - not what the actual program was.

#### Verifying execution example
Here is a simple example of verifying execution of the program from the previous example:
```Rust
use distaff;

let program =   /* value from previous example */;
let proof =     /* value from previous example */;

// let's verify program execution
match distaff::verify(program.hash(), &[], &[8], &proof) {
    Ok(_) => println!("Execution verified!"),
    Err(msg) => println!("Execution verification failed: {}", msg)
}
```

## Design

Distaff VM is a simple [stack machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine). This means all values live on the stack and all operations work with values near the top of the stack. 

### The stack
Currently, Distaff VM stack can be up to 32 items deep (this will be increased in the future). However, the more stack space a program uses, the longer it will take to execute, and the larger the execution proof will be. So, it pays to use stack space judiciously.

Values on the stack must be elements of a [prime field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) with modulus `340282366920938463463374557953744961537` (which can also be written as 2<sup>128</sup> - 45 * 2<sup>40</sup> + 1). This means that all valid values are in the range between `0` and `340282366920938463463374557953744961536` - this covers almost all 128-bit integers.   

All arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication) also happen in the same prime field. This means that overflow happens after a value exceeds field modulus. So, for example: `340282366920938463463374557953744961536 + 1 = 0`.

Besides being field elements, values in Distaff VM are untyped. However, some operations expect binary values and will fail if you attempt to execute them using non-binary values. Binary values are values which are either `0` or `1`.

### Inputs / outputs
Currently, there are 3 ways to get values onto the stack:

1. You can use `PUSH` operations to push values onto the stack as shown [here](#Program-execution-example). These values become a part of the program itself, and, therefore, cannot be changed between program executions. You can think of them as constants.
2. You can initialize the stack with a set of public inputs as described [here](#Program-inputs). Because these inputs are public, they must be shared with a verifier for them to verify program execution.
3. You can provide unlimited number of secret inputs via input tapes `A` and `B`. Similar to public inputs, these tapes are defined as a part of [program inputs](#Program-inputs). To move secret inputs onto the stack, you'll need to use `READ` operations as described [here](#Input-operations).

Values remaining on the stack after a program is executed can be returned as program outputs. You can specify exactly how many values (from the top of the stack) should be returned. Currently, the number of outputs is limited to 8. A way to return a large number of values (hundreds or thousands) is not yet available, but will be provided in the future.

### Instruction set

### Program hash

As described [here](#Executing-a-program), one of the values produced by Distaff VM after executing a program is program hash. This hash is a reduction of all program instructions into a single 32-byte value. The hash is generated as follows:

1. First, the program is padded with `NOOP` operations. The padding ensures that:
   1. The program consists of at least 16 operations.
   2. The number of operations is a power of 2 (16, 32, 64 etc.).
2. Then, a hash function is used to sequentially hash all instructions together. This hash function is based on Rescue hash function - however, it deviates significantly from the original construction. Security implications of this deviation have not been analyzed. It is possible that this hashing scheme is insecure, and will need to be changed in the future.

The hash function works as follows:

First, a state of 4 field elements is initialized to `0`. Then, the following procedure is applied:
```
for each op_code in the program do:
    add round constants;
    apply s-box;
    apply MDS;
    state[0] = state[0] + state[2] * op_code;
    state[1] = state[1] * state[3] + op_code;
    add round constants;
    apply inverse s-box;
    apply MDS;
```
where `op_code` is the opcode of the operation being executed on the VM. As mentioned above, this is based on the Rescue hash function but with the following significant differences:
1. The opcodes of the program are injected into the state in the middle of every round.
2. The number of rounds is equal to the number of operations in the program.

After the above procedure has been applied for all operations of the program, the first two elements of the state are returned as the hash of the program.

### Turing-completeness
Distaff VM is unlikely to be [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) in the foreseeable future. However, even now, you can use `CHOOSE` instructions to simulate conditional branches. In the future, more sophisticated ways to support conditional execution, and maybe even bounded loops, will be added.

### Memory
Currently, Distaff VM has no random access memory - all values live on the stack. However, a memory module will be added in the future to enable saving values to and reading values from RAM.

## Fibonacci calculator
Let's write a simple program for Distaff VM. This program will compute the 5-th [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

```
PUSH 0      // stack state: 0
PUSH 1      // stack state: 1 0
SWAP        // stack state: 0 1
DUP2        // stack state: 0 1 0 1
DROP        // stack state: 1 0 1
ADD         // stack state: 1 1
SWAP        // stack state: 1 1
DUP2        // stack state: 1 1 1 1
DROP        // stack state: 1 1 1
ADD         // stack state: 2 1
SWAP        // stack state: 1 2
DUP2        // stack state: 1 2 1 2
DROP        // stack state: 2 1 2
ADD         // stack state: 3 2
```
Notice that except for the first 2 operations which initialize the stack, the sequence of `SWAP DUP2 DROP ADD` operations repeats over and over. In fact, we can repeat these operations an arbitrary number of times to compute an arbitrary Fibonacci number. In Rust, it would like like this (this is actually a simplified version of the example in [fibonacci.rs](https://github.com/GuildOfWeavers/distaff/blob/master/src/examples/fibonacci.rs)):
```Rust
use distaff::{ ProofOptions, ProgramInputs, processor, processor::opcodes::f128 as opcodes };

// set the number of terms to compute
let n = 50;

// build the program
let mut program = vec![opcodes::BEGIN];
for _ in 0..(n - 1) {
    program.push(opcodes::SWAP);
    program.push(opcodes::DUP2);
    program.push(opcodes::DROP);
    program.push(opcodes::ADD);
}

// initialize the stack with values 0 and 1
let inputs = ProgramInputs::from_public(&[1, 0]);

// execute the program
let (outputs, program_hash, proof) = processor::execute(
        &program,
        &inputs,
        1,          // top stack item is the output
        &ProofOptions::default());

// the output should be the 50th Fibonacci number
assert_eq!(vec![12586269025], outputs);
```
Above, we used public inputs to initialize the stack rather than using `PUSH` operations. This makes the program a bit simpler, and also allows us to run the program from arbitrary starting points without changing program hash.

This program is rather efficient: the stack never gets more than 4 items deep.

## Performance
Here are some very informal benchmarks of running the Fibonacci calculator on Intel Core i5-7300U @ 2.60GHz (single thread) for a given number of operations (remember, it takes 3 operations to compute a single Fibonacci term):

| Operation Count | Execution time | Execution RAM  | Verification time | Proof size |
| --------------- | :------------: | :------------: | :---------------: | :--------: |
| 2<sup>8</sup>   | 180 ms         | negligible     | 2 ms              | 57 KB      |
| 2<sup>10</sup>  | 300 ms         | negligible     | 2 ms              | 78 KB      |
| 2<sup>12</sup>  | 900 ms         | < 100 MB       | 2 ms              | 101 KB     |
| 2<sup>14</sup>  | 3.5 sec        | ~ 350 MB       | 3 ms              | 124 KB     |
| 2<sup>16</sup>  | 14.4 sec       | 1.4 GB         | 3 ms              | 156 KB     |
| 2<sup>18</sup>  | 1 min          | 5.2 GB         | 3 ms              | 188 KB     |
| 2<sup>20</sup>  | 15 min         | > 5.6 GB       | 4 ms              | 225 KB     |

A few notes about the results:
1. Execution time is dominated by the proof generation time. In fact, the time needed to run the program is only about 0.05% of the time needed to generate the proof.
2. For 2<sup>20</sup> case, RAM on my machine maxed out at 5.6 GB, but for efficient execution ~16 GB would be needed. This probably explains why proving time is so poor in this case as compared to other cases. If there was sufficient RAM available, execution time would have likely been around 4 mins.
3. The benchmarks use default proof options which target 120-bit security level. The security level can be increased by either increasing execution time or proof size. In general, there is a trade-off between proof time and proof size (i.e. for a given security level, you can reduce proof size by increasing execution time, up to a point).

## References
Proofs of execution generated by Distaff VM are based on STARKs. A STARK is a novel proof-of-computation scheme that allows you to create an efficiently verifiable proof that a computation was executed correctly. The scheme was developed by Eli-Ben Sasson and team at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. STARKs do not require an initial trusted setup, and rely on very few cryptographic assumptions.
